### Datasets

- Arrests: This dataset contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. This is the most important metric because nobody wants to live in a crime-ridden neighborhood, even if it has a lot of parks. [link](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data)

- Parks: This dataset contains information on parks pittsburgh neighborhoods. Parks play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life in a neighborhood. They provide recreational spaces and facilities for residents, making them an important factor in determining the overall quality of a neighborhood. [link](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks)

- K-12 Students: This dataset contains K-12 enrollment information from all neightborhoods. The number of gifted K-12 students can reflect the educational resources available in each neighborhood. We assume that neighborhoods with more gifted students have better or more schools. This is a crucial factor for students and their parents.
